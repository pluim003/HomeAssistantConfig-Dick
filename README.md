# HomeAssistantConfig-Dick

Here you'll find my HomeAssistant-configuration.
I run HomeAssistant in a Docker container on a Raspberry Pi 4B.

This is a working configuration in my environment.

Feel free to use stuff from it. The configuration is created by me where I also have made use of others.

Note: as Dutch is my main language names/aliases/friendly_names will be Dutch.
